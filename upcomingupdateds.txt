I am interested in learning about cyber security
and have built scripts for hacking and automation. 
I enjoy upgrading these programs and adding new features.
Regarding the password generator, what can be updated?
 1. Encrypt passwords and preserve them securely. 
 2. Use a genuine database for greater convenience and features.
 3. Show and hide password features. 
 4. Create a separate database for users to utilize and continue.
